# Regression Models in Machine Learning  

This repository contains implementations of various **regression algorithms** in Machine Learning using Python. Each model is implemented in a separate Jupyter Notebook for clarity and learning purposes.  

Regression is a fundamental supervised learning technique used for **predicting continuous values** (e.g., predicting salary, house prices, sales).

## 📌 Regression Models Implemented  

1. **Simple Linear Regression**  
   - Predicts target using a single independent variable.  
   - Example: Predicting salary based on years of experience.  

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   - Predicts target using multiple independent variables.  
   - Example: Predicting profit based on R&D spend, Administration, and Marketing spend.  

3. **Polynomial Regression**  
   - Extends linear regression by adding polynomial terms for non-linear data.  
   - Example: Predicting salary trends with higher-order polynomials.  

4. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
   - Uses Support Vector Machines for regression tasks.  
   - Works well with non-linear data by applying kernel tricks.  

5. **Decision Tree Regression**  
   - Splits data into regions and predicts values using decision rules.  
   - Example: Predicting salary using tree-based splitting.  

6. **Random Forest Regression**  
   - An ensemble of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.  
   - Example: More robust salary predictions with random forest.
